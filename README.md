Hey I'm rapidcow!

I mess with computer sometimes, and I know some stuff I guess.
I use Python and Perl disproportionately (but I am learning Go
and Rust!) and I'm a big fan of anything that has to do with
free software.

In the real world I am neither a cow, nor so much "rapid"....
But I don't feel like putting GitHub or scrapers my name here
so ask me if you must. :)
