Hi, I’m Yizheng!  A high school senior passionate about math, art/music,
CS and many other stuff!  I taught myself [Python][] starting in 2020
and have been loving it ever since!  (I’ve tried other languages
but I don’t regularly use any of them, so I won’t brag about them here…)

The only repo I am vehemently working on is the [Perspective library
I use for backing up my own diaries][perspective] (written for Python 3).
If not for its importance I would probably be focusing on something else
now.  (Just telling you I don’t really have that much time on my hands…)

You can reach me via thegentlecow / eyzmeng at gmail dot com thru email,
or yizmeng on Discord! :)
