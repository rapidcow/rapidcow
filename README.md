Hi, I’m @rapidcow!  Currently a high school student in China.  Mostly 
self-taught and particularly fond of [Python][].

You can find me at <thegent1ecow7513@gmail.com>, or <2462257029@qq.com> since 
I can access it anywhere in China.\
(Yes, I know people normally name their accounts with their real name, but 
I’ve never collab’d with anyone so far and I’m a total newbie at GitHub...)
