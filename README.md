I'm Yizheng! aka rapidcow!

I mess with computer sometimes, and I know some stuff I guess.
I use Python disproportionately and I'm a big fan of anything
that has to do with free software.

If you like writing diaries, you might like to hear that
[I wrote code for it](https://github.com/rapidcow/perspective)!
(Yes - this is actually what I use. It's pretty much barebone
but it makes me feel safe since everything is stored as plain-old
text files.)

Also, if you have questions regarding anything I have here,
please email me at
[thegentlecow at gmail.com](mailto:thegentlecow@gmail.com).
(I don't have many friends anyways, so I mean it. Don't feel bad!)
