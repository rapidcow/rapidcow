<!-- ooh so these are supposed to be invisible i guess -->

Hi, I’m @rapidcow, a high school junior passionate about math,
art/music, CS and many other stuff!  I taught myself [Python][] starting
in 2020 and have been loving it ever since!  (I’ve tried other languages
but I don’t regularly use any of them, so I won’t brag about them here…)

<!--
Though if I were to rank the languages I've used in my "subjective"
feeling of familiarity:

*  Java (AP CS A was a piece of cake for me, though to be perfectly
   fair i've never done any big project with it)
*  C (only that i spent a lot of time on it XD)
*  C++ (forced to switch from Python to C++ for USACO XD)
*  HTML and CSS (but only a TINY tiny bit)
*  Ruby and Perl (i know SOME stuff... and that's it)
*  and of course i know basic shell script (i use bash)
-->

The only repo I am vehemently working on is the [Perspective library
I use for backing up my own diaries][perspective] (written for Python 3).
If not for its importance I would probably be focusing on something else
now.  (Just telling you I don’t really have that much time on my hands…)
