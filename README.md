Hey I'm rapidcow!

I mess with computer sometimes, and I know some stuff I guess.
I use Python disproportionately and I'm a big fan of anything
that has to do with free software.  (The first piece of information
is no longer accurate after [issue #121515](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121515).
My language of choice is now Perl 5, the Unix shell, and C.)

I currently don't have any open source projects in mind, at least
one to which I am certain that I will be able to put in consistent
commitment.  As such, there are no public repositories besides forks. :(
(I'll try to purge inactive forks to clear up workspace, eh....)

You can reach me via any e-mail you find in the commits I authored,
with the exception of the ones with a domain of github.com.
(To check with Git, a ``git log`` suffices.
To check on GitHub, [append ``.patch`` to the commit URL](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6188624).)
Otherwise, I think you can use devel (at) (my username) (dot) org.
Do prefer [sending in plain text](https://useplaintext.email/)!
