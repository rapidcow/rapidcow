Hey I'm rapidcow!

I mess with computer sometimes, and I know some stuff I guess.
I use Python and Perl disproportionately (but I am learning Go
and Rust!) and I'm a big fan of anything that has to do with
free software.

You can reach me via any email you find in the commits I authored,
with the exception of the no-reply mailboxes with the github.com
domain.  (To check with Git, a ``git log`` suffices.
To check on GitHub, [append ``.patch`` to the commit URL](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6188624).)
Otherwise, I think you can use **devel** (at) (my username) (dot) org.

I prefer [plain text email](https://useplaintext.email/).
If you are technical person, I *expect* plain text email.
Please avoid Microsoft Outlook and consider using a decent mail client.
(Pro tip: Your mail client (MUA) is a separate software from your mail
server.  While your university, institution, and/or company may use Outlook,
you can use a different mail client that is actually good (or at the very
least, not bad).  Many people use Outlook, thinking it is the only way
they can interact with their email account; **it is not.**  Mail protocols
(IMAP/SMTP) exist for that very reason.)

(To technical people again:
Please do not paste code snippets into Outlook.  Save it as a file,
and attach it as a MIME attachment.  I have a very hard time converting
Outlook's repulsive vomit-inducing inline-CSS-ridden HTML into plain text.
Please do not use Outlook.  I beg you.  You are better than this.  Ask AI
or something; you will figure it out, I promise.  If you must, I would much
prefer that you send the whole email as a plain text *attachment* to you use.
This is not an exaggeration.  Plain text brings me joy.  Microsoft Outlook
HTML only makes me want to burn the emails which carry such plague with fire.)

## credit

My profile picture is somehow [Cain](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Cain) here too?

from Ward's Tumblr (i didn't draw him!!!)

(I have no idea how he got here..... now that he's here I actually
kind of want to keep him???  ~~he's so adorable omagosh ToT~~)

## ABOUT J\*B

**Employers!**  Please note that I have a separate impersonal
school / work account **[&#x40;eyzmeng](https://github.com/eyzmeng)**.

Please note that I also have a designated email for employment
(aka j\*b *violent coughing*).  For your reference, it should be
**hire** (at) (my username) (dot) org, *not* **devel** or
literally anything else.  And for your reference again,
www (dot) (my username) (dot) org is **not** my "personal"
website; www.endfindme.com is.  You will not find a CV there
(though to be honest, I don't have a CV anywhere yet :P)

People also say I am too young to be hired so keep that in mind.

## where are all the repos?

I use:

* Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/rapidcow
* SourceHut: https://git.sr.ht/~rapidcow/

I prefer SourceHut for its email-driven discussion and
pull request model -- data is everything, and I like
managing old-school emails than pull requests with the
fancy Markdown and stuff.  [Free software needs free tools][]! :)
(and preferably uncomplicated, low-resource, and doesn't require
a GUI to access.  Hence email over pull requests -- again.)

[Free software needs free tools]: https://mako.cc/writing/hill-free_tools.html

The only exception are forks of code that is already hosted here,
third-party integrations (such as Homebrew taps and Hacklily
sheet music), and some abhorrently large repositories that should
only be suffered by a Gitweb provider as gratuituous as the child
of Microsoft Corporation itself.
