I'm Yizheng! aka rapidcow!

I mess with computer sometimes, and I know some stuff I guess.
I use Python disproportionately and I'm a big fan of anything
that has to do with free software.

If you like writing diaries, you might like to hear that
[I wrote code for it](https://git.rapidcow.org/perspective/about/)!
Oh yeah, if you noticed projects missing, it's probably because
I moved them to [my server](https://git.rapidcow.org). If you didn't,
well you'd probably get used to my place anyways, and that'd make
my job even easier :)
