Hey I'm rapidcow!

I mess with computer sometimes, and I know some stuff I guess.
I use Python disproportionately and I'm a big fan of anything
that has to do with free software.

If you like writing diaries, you might like to hear that I
wrote code for it! Here is where you can expect to find them:

  * <https://git.rapidcow.org/perspective/about/>
  * <https://codeberg.org/rapidcow/perspective>

**Update**: git.rapidcow.org is closed indefinitely, and
the Perspective project is (provisionally) restricted to my
private use.  I kind of forgot why I decided to make my
repositories public, given that the only reason I did so was
that people were doing the same on GitHub as an obligatory
programming "skill" to learn.

The web really is no place for projects this personal:
you are not my friend, and I am not some saint typing hundreds
of hours worth of code just to throw it all away and let the
bots and web crawlers smear my stuff everywhere.  I don't think
anyone could bear the thought of that happening to something
they deem important and personal.
